# Artificial Intelligence 23/24

This repository contains the practical assignments for the Artificial Intelligence course at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP) in the 2023/24 academic year. 

Each folder (a1 and a2) contains the details and source code related to each of the practical assignments.

## Heuristic Search Methods for Problem-Solving ([A1](a1))

**Theme chosen:** Metaheuristics for Optimization/Decision Problems - Delivery Scheduling

**Description:** The objective is to develop multiple algorithms to optimize the delivery order of packages in a scenario where there exists packages of three types - fragile, normal, and urgent - must be transported to various delivery locations. Each algorithm should aim to minimize damage to the fragile packages as well as travel costs incurred for each kilometer traveled, and adhere to time constraints for urgent packages. This problem is based on the classic Traveling Salesperson problem. The system will solve multiple instances of this problem using different algorithms and the results will be compared.

## Supervised Learning ([A2](a2))

**Theme chosen:** Glioma Grading Clinical and Mutation Features

**Description:** This assignment involves applying supervised learning algorithms to classify examples based on a target concept. It includes an exploratory data analysis, employing various learning algorithms, and comparing them using evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and accuracy. At least three algorithms such as Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and K-NN are to be used, with results presented using tables or plots.
